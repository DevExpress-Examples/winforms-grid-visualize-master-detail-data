# WinForms Data Grid - Visualize master-detail data (runtime)

This example shows how to bind the WinForms Grid Control to the **NorthWind** database and implement master-detail relationships (Category-Product).

The `GridView` displays data from the **Categories** data table. The `CardView` displays data from the **Products** data table. These data tables are linked by a master-detail relationship that is set up in code.
